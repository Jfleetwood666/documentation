# Wire Network Weights

## TL;DR
Wire Network will be rewarding Code Contributors for helping build and add value to the project. Contributors will ultimately be rewarded in Wire token (or $WIRE) for their contributions. The emissions for Code Contributors are calculated based on "weights". An individual's allocation is equal to the individual's weights divided up by the total number of weights times the daily $WIRE emissions. Coders are competing to provide high quality code at the best price, and then maintain that code and their weight in the Code Contributors' rewards.

## Introduction
Wire Network is dedicating a large portion of its token supply to support open-source Code Contributors.

The weights system is designed to establish a structure that encourages participation by clarifying the process, setting clear expectations, rewarding past contributions, and explaining how to maintain weights.

## Weights Emissions Schedule & Supply Cap
The weights earned by Coders are only valuable if they are scarce. The emissions schedule and the number of Coder weights available will be outlined in the coming weeks.  

## Calculating The Implied Value of Weights for Snapshot #1
> [!NOTE]
> The following is all theory, presented as an example for how one could arrive at their own estimate. 
> No one knows how much $WIRE will be worth in ETH or USD or any other currency after it launches. 1 $WIRE = 1 $WIRE.

In this initial Snapshot, we shall assume that the Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.01 USD per Weight. 

### Continuous Maintenance Requirement

The Weights are not just for one-off contributions. Code Contributors are required to maintain their code and continually update it as needed. 

Therefore, when calculating their Weights, they should assume that the Weights are what they value Contribution and the requirement of keeping it updated. 

As a rule of thumb, you can think of it the Weights as what you'd value the work on a monthly basis. We encourage early contributors to work on more ambitious and long-term projects for Wire Network, and Contributors should then calculate their weights based on what they value their contributions on a monthly basis. 

### Calculations

For Snapshot #1, calculations are simply (The value your contributions in USD) divided by $0.01, which is the Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight. 

For example, if you believe your contributions are worth $5,000 USD per month, then your weights you should submit are ($5,000) divided by 0.01, which equals 500,000 Weights. 

> [!NOTE]
> Whatever you believe the value of your contributions are may not be the equate to the value others see in it. As a result, Weights are subject to review by other Contributors. See below.

## Review Period for Weights

Every Code Contributor likely values their contributions, time, and efforts differently. 

Therefore, to maximize fairness, prior to the solidification of the weights in Snapshot #1, there shall be a Review Period where we will welcome Code Contributors to review one another's submissions and establish a process for disputing entries that seem too low or too high for a specific contributions.
