*Kyle Dolan, Ken DiCross, Joseph Rubin* 

**Abstract.** Wire Network presents a state-of-the-art blockchain platform that addresses the pivotal challenges holding back the third generation of the internet. We offer a holistic approach to solving the decentralization, security, scalability, onboarding, and interoperability problems in blockchain. Wire Network’s novel Appointed Proof of Stake (APoS) consensus model ensures optimal decentralization and robust security. Moreover, Wire Network establishes the world’s first truly trustless cross-chain communication by combining Wire Name Service (WNS) with the open-source Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol (UPAP). Furthermore, Wire Network introduces a revolutionary Crypto Single Sign-On (SSO), coupled with the world’s first on-chain & decentralized password reset feature, significantly simplifying the onboarding process and user experience. In addition, Wire Network is the only blockchain to consider and solely run on trustless hardware, operating on open-source principles and eliminating dependencies on third-party entities, while an inventive node and governance structure further fortify network integrity. Collectively, Wire Network's breakthroughs harbor the potential to be a catalyst in propelling blockchain technology to new horizons and facilitating mass adoption. 

**1  Introduction** 

In  virtually  every  industry,  blockchain  technology  harbors transformative potential. But, for blockchain to actualize its potential, it needs to offer equivalent or superior performance compared to traditional centralized systems, at a competitive price,  while  providing  new  capabilities.  As  of  now,  the combined transaction per second (TPS) capacity of all existing blockchains still falls far short of what is required to support even  a  single  mainstream  enterprise  application.  Wire Network is designed to fill this void. In this paper, we present a  blockchain  ecosystem  with  the  ability  to  scale  to  never- before-seen  TPS  benchmarks.  This  paper  introduces  Wire Network, not as an insular platform, but as an offering of holistic  web3  standards  that  can  operate  and grow  via  the open-source community, independent of us. With innovative features like trustless cross-chain transactions, a shared pool of decentralized computing resources, a crypto-based single sign- on, and decentralized password reset, Wire Network aims to redefine  blockchain  technology  and  catalyze  its  mass adoption. This study presents an in-depth exploration of the Wire  Network's  core  technologies,  potential  applications, trustless  hardware,  and  potential  for  enhancing  blockchain adoption at scale. 

**2  Background & Related Works** 

Bitcoin  [1]  and  Ethereum  [2],  as  pioneering  blockchain networks,  have undeniably  revolutionized  the  landscape  of digital  currencies  and  decentralized  applications;  however, their  scalability  constraints  and  exorbitant  transaction  fees present critical challenges that necessitate the development of more efficient, faster, and cost-effective blockchain protocols. Subsequent  protocols  have  endeavored  to  address  various fundamental issues inherited from Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet a  holistic  solution  has  remained  elusive  in  the  blockchain domain; this gap is addressed by Wire Network, which offers an integrated approach to overcoming the industry's pervasive challenges.  

In our analysis, the quintessential hurdles impeding the advancement  of  the  blockchain  industry  encompass (1) decentralization,  reflecting  the  dispersion  of  control  and avoidance of single points of failure; (2) security, concerning the  safeguarding  of  network  integrity  and  user  assets;  (3) scalability, or the capacity to efficiently handle a burgeoning volume of transactions; (4) onboarding, involving the ease and accessibility for users and developers to adopt and interact with  blockchain  technologies;  and  (5)  interoperability,  the ability for diverse blockchain networks to communicate and collaborate seamlessly in a trustless and decentralized manner.  

2.1 **Decentralization  &  Security**   In  public  blockchains, decentralization  is  primarily  assessed  by  examining  the distribution of resources governing block generation, which is intrinsically linked to security and scalability. A concentration of these resources among a few entities signifies centralization, thereby compromising security. This security concern arises from the potential for collusion among these entities, enabling denial-of-service attacks and censorship against selected users or the alteration of blockchain historical records [3].  Even today,  Ethereum  is  still  plagued  by  serious  censorship challenges, where a significant portion of blocks are created by entities that selectively exclude transactions to comply with regulations  and  sanctions,  which  undermines  the  intended neutrality and openness of the blockchain [4][5].  

All  networks  seem  to  suffer  from  some  degree  of centralization [6], but there seems to be general agreement that Bitcoin  is  still  one  of  the  most  secure  and  decentralized networks [7], despite its other limitations. However, Li and Palanisamy  argue  that  Larimer’s  Delegated  Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)  [8],  used  in  Steemit,  BitShares,  and  EOS,  offers greater levels of decentralization than Bitcoin [3]. We agree; however, DPoS is still flawed due to issues regarding low voter turnout  [9],  wealth  concentration  [10],  and  voter  collusion [11], due to the lack of complete separation of powers  by conflating the roles of staking, voting, block production, and key authorization. Moreover, both Bitcoin and EOSIO-based networks lack the ability to measure the physical machine underpinning block production from a trusted boot-state. 

2.1.1 **The Hardware Problem**  Although the landscape of blockchain  networks  is  replete  with  endeavors  to  achieve impeccable  trustlessness  through  software  innovations,  an under-addressed dimension is the incorporation of trustless hardware, a critical component needed to properly fortify the security and integrity of these networks. In particular, the Intel Management  Engine  (IME),  a  microcontroller  embedded within Intel's chipsets, poses a substantial security concern for blockchain  systems  due  to  it  operating  black-box,  closed- source software at the kernel level, or ring zero, which is below the main operating system [12].

**Figure 1.** Diagram showing the privilege rings for the x86 available in protected mode. 

With access to vital system resources and operating in such a cloistered domain, the IME could potentially be exploited, critically undermining the foundational trust and security that blockchain  networks  strive  to  build  [13].  With  respect  to Figure 1, activities or exploits occurring in the lower-level rings (especially ring 0) have the potential to influence or compromise operations in the higher-level rings. Blockchain software  primarily  operates  at  the  application  level, corresponding  to  ring  3,  rendering  it  susceptible  to  any compromises  that  may  originate  from  the  more  privileged rings, including the kernel level at ring 0. Any closed-source proprietary software running on the machines can pose a threat to the security of the blockchain and user data; and, reliance on such software implicitly places trust in third-party entities like  Intel,  thereby  puncturing  the  notion  of  full decentralization, as the blockchain remains tethered to and contingent  upon  the  integrity  of  external,  closed-source components. 

2.1.2 **Cross-Chain Transactions**  In the current landscape of blockchain  technology,  achieving  secure  and  truly decentralized transactions across different chains remains an elusive goal. To facilitate cross-chain interactions, bridges and oracles are commonly employed; bridges serve as point-to- point mechanisms  for transferring  assets and  data  between different blockchains, while oracles provide external data to smart contracts to facilitate those transactions. However, both bridges and oracles often entail elements of centralization and present security vulnerabilities, as they become critical points of  control  and  potential  failure,  thus  compromising  the trustless  nature that is  the hallmark  of blockchain  systems [14][15].

In  February  2022,  the  Wormhole  token  bridge  was hacked for $321 million [16]; in March 2022, the blockchain game Axie Infinity lost $625 million from a bridge exploit [17];  and,  in  June  2022,  the  network  Harmony’s  Horizon Bridge was hacked for $100 million [18]. Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps (ACCS) present a promising alternative to bridges for facilitating decentralized asset transfers between blockchains [19];  however,  their  path  to  scaling  and  mass  adoption  is impeded  by  a  confluence  of  challenges  and  limitations, including  technical  complexity  that  makes  them  less accessible to average users, liquidity constraints particularly for  less  popular  assets,  limited  compatibility  with  various blockchains, and a user experience that often lacks the polish and ease of use provided by centralized solutions [20]. 

A major challenge within the current landscape lies in the lack of standardization. Similar to significant transitions seen in the history of internet technology, such as the shift from SSL to TLS for secure internet communication or the evolution of JavaScript and gradual phase-out of older technologies like Flash  and  ActiveX,  blockchain  transactions  necessitate standardization in addressing and transaction form factors to foster  better  compatibility,  security,  and  user  experience [21][22][23]. 

2.2 **Scalability**   In  the  nascent  stages  of  blockchain technology, exemplified by the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, scalability  was  not  a  central  concern;  however,  as  the technology  gained  traction,  the  limitations  of  early blockchains,  such  as  Bitcoin's  7  transactions  per  second, became apparent, highlighting the critical need for scalability [24]. Scaling  is  indispensable  for  blockchain  networks  to handle  an  increasing  volume  of  transactions  efficiently, accommodate  a  growing  user  base,  and  meet  the  diverse requirements  of  various  use  cases,  ranging  from  financial services to supply chain management. As of today, despite numerous efforts and innovations ranging from sharding and layer-2  solutions  to  alternative  consensus  algorithms,  the blockchain space continues to grapple with the trilemma of seeking a balanced trade-off between scalability, security, and decentralization, and a consensus on an optimal approach to achieve  scalability  without  compromising  the  fundamental tenets of blockchain remains elusive [25].** 

2.3 **Onboarding & User-Friendly Tools**  During the initial proliferation  of  blockchain,  the  technology  was  primarily geared  towards  enthusiasts  and  early  adopters,  with  little emphasis on ease of use or accessibility for a broader audience. The  multifaceted  nature  of  blockchain  interactions, encompassing  cryptographic keys,  addresses,  gas  fees,  and token management, poses significant barriers to entry for non- technical users or laymen, stifling broader adoption. Today, there  is  an  increasing  recognition  within  the  blockchain ecosystem  that  user-friendly  tools,  intuitive  interfaces,  and streamlined  onboarding  processes  are  essential  for democratizing  access  to  blockchain  technologies  [26].  By reducing the complexity and technical know-how required for engagement, these user-centric solutions have the potential to open  the  gates  for  a  more  diverse  audience,  fostering  the integration  of  blockchain  technologies  into  everyday applications and services.** 

**3  Consensus** 

3.1 **Appointed Proof of Stake Model**  For Wire Network, we have invented a novel consensus mechanism called Appointed 

Proof-of-Stake (APoS), similar to DPoS, but APoS seeks to further separate the powers of stakeholders from influencing the block production and validation process by implementing a  governing  council  (the  “Council”)  as  an  intermediary. Moreover, Wire Network uses a hierarchical node structure where  the  Council  is  “appointed”  by  the  network’s  Tier-1 (“T1”) Node Owners, and after the Council is elected, the T1 Node  Owners  have  no  ability  to  impeach  or  control  them within the Wire protocol. In the Wire ecosystem, the stakers or stakeholders are the Node Owners, and the block producers are the Node Operators. Furthermore, the Council selects the Node Operators  and  the  order  in  which  the  Node  Operators  are utilized is determined by their length of compliance with the network.  Node  Owners  are  tasked  with  authorizing  and deauthorizing  public  keys,  which  provide  authority  to  the Node Operators, and Owners are also tasked with measuring that Operators remain in compliance. By separating the block production,  staking,  and  governing  into  these  three independent roles, Wire Network avoids virtually all of the deficiencies  of  traditional  proof-of-stake  and  DPoS  chains, thereby  enhancing  security,  decentralization,  and  fairness within the ecosystem. 

3.2 **Node Structure and Tiers**  Wire Network’s tiered node structure  provides  distinct  roles  and  responsibilities  for different levels of commitment to the network. For the first three tiers, a significant amount of Wire tokens ($WIRE) must be staked. The node tier’s hierarchical arrangement, along with the  economic  incentives  from  the  Wire  token  and  the allocation of system resources, helps maintain the robustness, security, and decentralization of the network. 

**Tier 1: Primary Node Owners** 

The T1 Nodes, with a limited number of 21 seats at the outset, are the backbone of the network, entrusted with maintaining consensus and verifying transactions. T1 Nodes play a pivotal role  in  the  network’s  governance:  they  are  tasked  with submitting flights of candidates and voting in candidates to the Council (see Sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.5, respectively). Each T1 node  stakes  7.5  million  $WIRE,  rewarded  back  over  12 months, and shares 4% of the existing inventory of network resources. T1 node owners enjoy privileged access to future nodes in Wire Node Expansion (see Section 5.2). 

**Tier 2: Secondary Node Owners** 

Tier-2  (“T2”)  Nodes hold  an  equal  share  of 0.15%  of  the existing inventory. Each T2 Node stakes 1 million $WIRE, rewarded  back  over  24  months.  If  a  T1  Node  is  out  of compliance, then a Tier-2 (“T2”) Node will replace the non- compliant T1 Node and contribute to maintaining consensus and  verifying  transactions.  T2  Nodes  are  also  tasked  with endorsing  Wire  Improvement  Proposals  (WIPs),  which determines the priority in which the proposals are presented to the Council. In the first generation of Wire Network, there are 84 T2 Node seats. 

**Tier 3: Premier Citizens** 

Tier-3 (“T3”) Nodes, numbering 1,000 seats at launch, stake 100,000 $WIRE that is rewarded back over 36 months. Each T3 Node holds an equal share of 0.00045% of the existing inventory. T1 and T2 Nodes are the only ones that can power smart contracts, whereas T3 nodes can simply use their own resources given to their account. 

**Auxiliary Tiers** 

Wire Network has four additional tiers (Tier-4, Tier-5, Tier-6, and Tier-7) that each have their own role in the network. For example, Tier-4 Nodes represent a namespace in the Wire ecosystem. In addition, Tier-5 Nodes fund WIPs and reward a yield to backers that stake. See Section 4.3 for more on WIPs. 

3.2.1 **Wire Token Utility and System Resources**  The Wire token  serves  as  the  primary  digital  asset  within  the  Wire Network  ecosystem,  underpinning  various  functionalities across  the  platform.  The  token  is  employed  to  process transactions, store data, facilitate staking for Node Owners, and  participate  in  the  network's  governance  processes. Although  $WIRE  serves  as  the  core  token  for  the  Wire Network,  $WIRE  is  an  ERC-20  token  on  the  Ethereum mainnet. 

Wire Network introduces two types of system resources: $PWR and $INV. $PWR represents the computational power and network bandwidth associated with accounts, functioning as a regenerative resource. In contrast, $INV represents the RAM or storage capacity an account can consume, which is a non-regenerative resource. Users in need of more resources interact with the Resource Management Exchange (RMEX) system contract. Power and inventory are resources that are issued on lease from the smart contract deployer and cannot be transacted  by  the  end-user.  These  resources  have  no  max supply or total supply and are not fungible—these resources are delegated to each Node Owner account. 

The network’s transactions per second (TPS) is directly influenced  by  the  computational  power,  which  dictates transaction  processing  speed,  and  storage  capacity,  which determines the volume of transaction data that can be handled. 

3.2.2 **Tokenomics and Sustainability**  Wire's tokenomics aim  to  stimulate  both  short-term  and  long-term  incentives, fostering an environment conducive to effective operation of the  platform.  The  Wire  Network  is  fundamentally  a marketplace,  balancing  supply  from  stakeholders  and infrastructure providers against demand from developers and end-users. Through well-designed economic incentives, the platform  fosters  decentralization  and  broad  participation, helping  to  ensure  its  sustainability.  Moreover,  the  $WIRE token  serves  as  the  linchpin  for  decentralized  computation within the Wire Network ecosystem, effectively aligning with Moore's law by encapsulating the increasing affordability and demand  for  computational  resources.  As  such,  $WIRE symbolizes  a  fair-priced  mechanism  for  decentralized compute, with its scalability inherently bound by the limits of computational advancements.  

Unlike other blockchain designs, as computing becomes cheaper in line with Moore’s Law, so will the economic costs involved with Wire Network usage. Given that Wire consensus does not require exorbitant redundancies like the Ethereum consensus,  Wire  Network  has  a  path  to  scaling  that  is equivalent to centralized compute workflows. Wire Network only  needs  to  be  as  redundant  as  a  traditional  centralized enterprise would want its IT infrastructure. 

3.3 **Integration  of  Asynchronous  Byzantine  Fault Tolerance**  The APoS model only represents one-half of Wire Network’s  consensus.  The  other  half  is  the  process  of confirming each block until it reaches an immutable state, or finality, and this is performed via an asynchronous byzantine fault  tolerant  (aBFT)  approach. Thus,  there  are  two  layers comprising the Wire Network consensus model: 

Layer 1 - Native Consensus Model (aBFT) <br>
Layer 2 - Appointed Proof-of-Stake (APoS) 

The Wire Network consensus includes a strict time schedule whereby each block is produced every 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) and the model permits only a single Node Operator to create a block within the given time slot. Any failure in block production within the designated time frame results in a skipped slot and, in instances where one or more blocks are omitted, a temporal gap of at least 0.5 seconds ensues.  

In  terms  of  finality,  the  Wire  layer-1  blocks  become irreversible once they have been confirmed by two-thirds plus one of the T1 Nodes (i.e., 15 out of 21). Each Node Operator in the network produces a series of 12 blocks. When producing a block, an Operator includes a unique ID, which is essentially a hash digest of the content of the block. Importantly, this ID also contains the hash of the previous block, establishing a cryptographic link to the prior state of the blockchain. As the next Operator in the sequence produces its set of 12 blocks, it also includes the ID and confirmation of the blocks produced by  the  previous  Operator.  These  confirmations  serve  as validations of the state of the blocks produced by the preceding Operator. When 14 subsequent Operators have validated the blocks produced by an Operator through this hash linking and confirmation process, the blocks are considered irreversible. At  this  point,  the  network  has  achieved  finality  for  these blocks. Given the two-thirds plus one quorum and the 0.5- second block time, the time to finality on the Wire layer-1 blockchain is at least 90 seconds. 

**4  Governance Structure** 

Harnessing the power of decentralized blockchain technology, the Wire Network's governance model fosters fairness and transparency  through  a  Council  elected  in  a  fair  multistep process. This system can dynamically adapt to users’ needs and demands, continually improving the platform through a robust, user-influenced proposal system. Similar to the Wire token, the Wire Network governance will take place on other layer-1  and  layer-2  networks,  starting  with  the  Ethereum mainnet, enabling greater transparency and decentralization, due to the separation of powers of the governance from the Node  Operators  who  have  custody  of  Wire’s  layer-1 blockchain. 

4.1 **Council Elections**  The governance of the Wire Network is  managed  by  the  Council  elected  through  a  multi-step process. This Council is tasked with reviewing and voting on Wire Improvement Proposals (WIPs). The election process is as follows: 

4.1.1 **Defining a Qualified Candidate**  Any individual can become  a  candidate  to  be  considered  for  the  Council  by providing  their  Wire  username,  verifying  their  Twitteraccount, and providing any necessary KYC data. The Council members will be public figures, so it is recommended that candidates  campaign  accordingly,  ideally  sharing  video  or written statements explaining their motivations for wanting to join the Council.   

4.1.2 **Submission  to  the  Candidate  Pool**   So  long  as  a candidate is willing and is a Qualified Candidate, they can submit  themselves  to  the  Candidate  Pool.  Every  Qualified Candidate is able to submit themselves and will be accepted to the Candidate Pool. Even T1 Node Owners are allowed to submit  themselves  as  potential  candidates,  but  there  is  no guarantee that they will be elected to the Council.  

4.1.3 **Flight Submission**  T1 Node Owners then must each submit  a  flight  of  three  Qualified  Candidates  from  the Candidate Pool, and their submissions must be ranked in order of preference: first string, second string, and third string. All T1 Node Owners then vote on these submissions one-by-one, with  a  two-thirds  plus  one  supermajority  needed  for  a submission to pass.  

4.1.4 **Acceptance**  Prior to Flight Submission, the selected candidates must first accept their nomination by signing an ECDSA signature. 

4.1.5 **Voting**  After the flights have been submitted, voting begins. The voting process is an on-chain process structured in a circular manner, which can span three rounds – first, second, and third string. In each round, each T1 Node Owner casts a vote on each candidate. The votes are cast in phases, with each phase  representing  a  vote  on  an  individual  candidate.  If  a candidate secures a supermajority in a round, they are selected. So,  for  example,  if  a  first-string  candidate  receives  a supermajority, then they get approved to the Council and the second-  and  third-string  candidates  are  not  considered. Moreover,  it  doesn’t  matter  if  the  second-  or  third-string candidates would have received more votes if voted upon.  

If none of a T1 Node Owner’s candidates pass the first three rounds, the Council seat is then delegated to a vote by the T2 Nodes and a T2 Node Owners are randomly selected to submit flights of candidates until one achieves supermajority (and, in this first generation, it would require two-thirds plus one of the 84 T2 Node Owners). If the T2 Node Owners are unable  to  elect  the  required  Council  members,  then  the responsibility is similarly passed on to the T3 Node Owners; however, such a scenario is highly unlikely. 

4.1.6 **Confirmation**  After candidates are elected (i.e., they receive 2/3 + 1 in the voting process), then the electees must confirm their acceptance and appointment to the Council by signing another ECDSA signature. 

4.2 **Proposed Instruction Sets**  Instruction sets form the core of the Wire Network's operation. These sets, also known as Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), provide a precise definition of all the operations that a computer or device must support. Each instruction is represented by a sequence of bits and is divided into fields corresponding to the constituent elements of the instruction. 

4.3 **Wire Improvement Proposals (WIPs)**  WIPs are design documents providing information to the Wire community or describing new features for Wire or its processes. WIPs serve as  the  primary  mechanism  for  proposing  new  features, collecting  community  input,  and  documenting  design decisions that will shape Wire. 

A WIP must provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The WIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting  dissenting  opinions.  For  Wire  implementers, WIPs provide a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. 

The lifecycle of a WIP is as follows: Create > Draft > Last Call > Accepted > Final. The submission process involves reviewing  the  WIP  structure,  forking  the  WIP  repository, adding the WIP to the fork of the repository using a provided template, and finally, submitting a Pull Request to Wire's WIP repository. 

A WIP must include a preamble, a simple summary, an abstract,  specification,  rationale,  information  on  backward compatibility, test cases, and implementations. Including the motivation behind the proposal is not required but is highly encouraged. 

**5  Scaling and Network Expansion** 

The  Wire  Network  is  designed  to  tackle  the  challenges associated with scalability, a critical issue in both centralized and  decentralized  systems  of  today.  It  leverages  a  unique approach to maintain an efficient platform that scales based on network usage, allowing the network to support enterprise- grade, globally-used applications with no upper limit. 

5.1 **Scalability**  Wire Network is designed to allow for both scaling  vertically  and  horizontally.  Vertical  scaling  in  the network would involve increasing the hardware requirements to be in compliance as a Node Operator. The Node Operators, who should be skilled in managing hardware, would have to make these changes and meet these specifications if they want to remain in compliance. Moreover, there are opportunities for commercial agreements to exist between the Wire Network Foundation and the Node Operators, whereby the Operators invest in compliant hardware to power the network, and in return, they stand to gain based on their length of compliance and  as  the  network  expands  its  requirements.  Horizontal scaling,  however,  would  involve  the  deployment  of  more block-producing  nodes  in  the  network,  distributing  the workload among them. Wire Network could employ a dual- chain state analogous to hyperthreading in computing. This involves the division of a single state into multiple parallel states, akin to multi-core processors. These parallel states are interdependent, meaning they are threads of each other and cannot function independently. This approach is likened to RAID 0 in data storage, where data is striped across two hard drives in an array; if one breaks, there is total data loss as the data is distributed across both drives. In Wire Network’s case, both sub-states would need to exist for the system to function effectively. This combination of both vertical and horizontal scaling options makes Wire Network highly scalable, ensuring efficiency and reliability as it grows. 

Inherent to Wire Network’s design is the implementation of Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT), which also confers upon Wire Network an ability to sustain network consensus without compromising on the speed and efficiency of communication. By assigning users to different instances and time slots, the transaction load is evenly distributed across the  network.  This  reduces  the  risk  of  any  single  instance becoming a bottleneck. 

By  allowing  for  both  vertical  and  horizontal  scaling, supported by aBFT consensus, the Wire Network effectively addresses  the  scalability  trilemma.  The  network's  unique architecture  can  optimize  transaction  efficiency  and communication speed, allowing for robust scalability while maintaining  security  and decentralization,  thus  offering  a viable solution to one of the most significant challenges faced by traditional blockchain networks. 

5.2 **Network Expansion Events**  The current iterations of Wire Network represent the first generation of the network. In order to scale and improve performance, the network must expand  to  bring  in  additional  resources  and  nodes.  The additional compute added into the network as a result of these expansion  events  represents  resources  for  the  new  nodes. These  expansions,  the  Network  Expansion  Events,  are triggered when a certain threshold of usage is reached. This threshold is a rolling average, and the parameters triggering these expansions must be determined by the Council.  

When  a  Network  Expansion  Event  is  triggered,  new nodes become available to claim by staking large amounts of $WIRE. In addition, when these events occur, the Council’s term ends, which means that no new WIPs are considered until all the new nodes have been claimed and another Council is properly elected. 

**6  Wire Name Service & UPAP** 

The  key  to  Wire  Network’s  cross-chain  solutions  and interoperability  is  the  Universal  Polymorphic  Address Protocol (or UPAP), which is an open-source communications standard. UPAP allows for seamless and trustless transactions across different blockchain networks by employing universal addressing  in  a  deterministic  mechanism  and  universal standards for transaction form factor. The goal of UPAP is to create a universal public key that you can get to from any addressing  format  created  by  blockchains  (e.g.,  in  this framework, if you know a user’s Ethereum address, then you can  derive  their  Solana  address  deterministically).  This technology  provides  developers  with  the  ability  to  create applications that allow for cross-chain communication without the need for bridges and oracles, which are both prone to exploitation. The Name Service Framework built on UPAP manifests itself as a chain-agnostic smart contract factory that enables the deployment of name service smart contracts on each network. These contracts allow asset ownership to be abstracted and finality enforced from the settlement layer. For Wire, we are deploying our own name service implementation called Wire Name Service (WNS).

With WNS, we will be deploying name service smart contracts on a number of popular blockchain networks like Ethereum.  These  smart  contracts  can  be  conceptualized  as universal escrow buckets that hold assets and enable a novel form  of  abstracted  ownership.  In  essence,  all  the  assets deposited within these smart contracts are owned by the users, yet they can span multiple networks without users needing native accounts or incurring the associated transaction costs on each  network.  The  name  service  smart  contracts  act  as enforcement of asset ownership state from deposit to finality, and in this case, finality refers to withdrawal from WNS. 

One key feature of WNS is the reverse compatibility with existing top-level domains (like .eth and .sol). Wire Network has reserved the “WNS” namespace on both Ethereum and Solana (i.e., wns.eth and wns.sol). As a result, Wire Network namespaces  can  be  used  as  recipients  on  either  of  these networks by prepending the beginning of the address with their username. For example, the user Bob.wire can receive assets on  Ethereum  at  bob.wns.eth  or  on  Solana  at  bob.wns.sol, alongside his ability to receive assets on the Wire layer-1 or any WNS-integrated networks via his Bob.wire username. 

There are four types of transactions in this UPAP and name service framework:  

1) Native  wallet  through  a  UPAP-enabled  dApp  to another native wallet, 
2) Transferring assets from a native wallet into the name service system, 
3) Transacting assets within the name service system, and 
4) Transferring assets out of the name service system. 

Let us consider the Wire blockchain network, Ethereum, and  Solana  in  conjunction  with  WNS  to  illustrate  UPAP's capabilities. When a WNS smart contract is deployed on each of these three separate layer-1 blockchains, these contracts communicate with both the Wire settlement layer and native layer-1s to transact with assets both within and outside the WNS system. 

**Use Case #1: Atomic Swap Across Blockchains** 

Suppose Bob possesses $100 of ETH on Ethereum and Alice has $100 of SOL on Solana, both stored in their respective UPAP-enabled wallets. If they wish to swap these assets, the WNS  system  can  perform  an  atomic  swap  on  the  Wire blockchain, which acts as the settlement layer. Either party can initiate this transaction using their UPAP-enabled wallet. For instance, Bob proposes a transaction to exchange his $100 in ETH  for  Alice's  $100  in  SOL.  Alice  then  finalizes  the transaction  in  her  UPAP-enabled  wallet,  resulting  in  the updated ownership being confirmed and reflected in the WNS system. 

**Use Case #2: Cross-chain Payments** 

Now, suppose Bob owes Alice $100 for dinner and has $100 of USDC in the Ethereum's WNS smart contract. If Alice possesses a UPAP-enabled wallet or a Wire username, Bob can simply send his USDC to Alice, with the transaction being settled on the Wire blockchain. But, if Alice only has a Solana wallet with a traditional Solana address, Bob can withdraw his USDC directly to Alice on Solana using his UPAP-enabled wallet, sending to her directly. This versatility highlights the protocol's  capability  to  perform  cross-chain  transactions seamlessly. 

UPAP's  essence  lies  in  the  principle  of  "abstracted ownership," where assets can be held and transacted across multiple  blockchain  networks  without  the  need  for  native accounts  or  incurring  network-specific  fees.  This  not  only 

enables seamless cross-chain transactions but also opens up many new opportunities for users to engage with digital assets, such as buying Ethereum NFTs on Ethereum without the need to pay for Ethereum’s immense gas fees. 

**7  Crypto SSO & Password Recovery** 

Wire  Network  employs  a  novel  account  registration  and onboarding for blockchain, which we are referring to as the Wire Network Crypto Single Sign-On (or Crypto SSO). In addition, our framework includes a decentralized  password reset system. The inclusion of these two features makes Wire Network geared for mass adoption, given the close parallels the features have to traditional web2 user experiences. 

7.1 **Account Structure**  Wire Network features an account structure with a permission-based system. Every Wire account possesses  two  default  permissions:  owner  and  active.  The owner  permission  can  change  both  owner  and  active permissions,  while  the  active  permission  can  only  modify itself.  Additionally,  these  permissions  can  have  individual keys or scoped permission links to other Wire namespaces, including people or smart contracts. A Wire Network account is identified by a namespace comprising 13 characters with a decimal point or 12 characters without. These characters range from A-Z and 1-5. After registering this namespace, two roles (owner and active) are linked to keys. 

7.2 **User Registration Process**  To sign-up for an account, a new  user  will  simply  input  their  username,  email,  and password, which establishes a permission link from the owner to  the  recovery  contract.  The  creator  of  the  account  then revokes their authority over the owner’s permission, and an active  key  is  set.  This key  is  generated  securely  from  the username, email, and password provided by the user without being transmitted over the internet. It mimics a web2 workflow since  consistently  entering  these  values  in  any  compatible system will deterministically generate the same key pair. 

The key provided to the user carries limited authority, with a higher authority linked to an immutable smart contract. This smart contract can reset the owner or active keys. When a user accumulates significant assets, they can use the active key to perform a transaction that sets a self-generated owner public  key,  unlinking  it  from  the  smart  contract,  and effectively assuming full control over the account. 

7.3 **Password  Recovery**   Wire  Network's  decentralized password  reset/recovery  process  involves  a  recovery  smart contract and the cooperation of authorities, which are the T1 and T2 Node Owners. These authorities commit partial secrets on-chain, which are used to generate a code that is sent to the user's  email.  The  password  reset  is  finalized  when  the authorities  reveal  their  sections  of  the  code,  and  the  user submits this combined code through an authorized dApp. 

**8  Trustless Open-Source Hardware** 

Wire network has built a fully open-source server platform including an open-source Hardware Security Module (HSM) as a foundation for its core consensus architecture. The goal is to create a secure and measurable computing environment for the operation of Wire Network and its layer-1 blockchain. This is achieved by neutralizing typical proprietary firmware, such as Intel's Management Engine (IME), and ensuring the system boots from a trusted state using open-source firmware. The hardware employs Coreboot, an open-source framework for building  firmware,  and  places  emphasis  on  securing  Ring Zero, which underpins the kernel. Moreover, Wire Network's HSM is custom-built and acts like a hardware wallet for the server, with all components and firmware being open-source. This module is crucial in ensuring security and can be audited and verified as it is isolated from the rest of the system. By employing this architecture, Wire Network makes sure that the computing environment is as trustworthy as the blockchain, allowing  for  remote  measurement  of  the  machine  state analogous to the blockchain state. 

**9  Conclusion** 

Wire  Network,  through  its  transformative  technologies, presents a paradigm shift in the blockchain landscape. It is the first  blockchain  ecosystem  to  holistically  address  both software  and  hardware  layers,  showcasing  unwavering dedication to open-source principles and standing as a beacon of transparency and integrity. At its core, the novel Appointed Proof of Stake (APoS) consensus model, coupled with Wire Name  Service  smart  contracts  and  UPAP,  offers  powerful solutions  for  the  central  challenges  of blockchain  security, scalability, and interoperability. 

Pioneering efforts have been undertaken to address the overlooked  hardware  security  issues  plaguing  the  industry. With  the  introduction  of  a  trustless  hardware  model,  Wire Network  aims  to  fortify  the  very  foundation  on  which blockchain  operates.  Moreover,  user  experience,  a  vital determinant of mass adoption, has been significantly enhanced through a groundbreaking decentralized Crypto Single Sign- On (SSO) and a first-of-its-kind decentralized password reset feature. 

These  collective  breakthroughs  not  only  redefine  the potential  of  blockchain  technology  but  also  set  a  new benchmark  for  its  adoption.  As  we  continue  to  push  the boundaries of what's possible with blockchain, Wire Network invites the broader open-source community to participate in this  exciting  journey  toward  a  decentralized  and  scalable future.  The  immense  potential  of  Wire  Network  is  still unfolding,  and  future  studies  will  delve  deeper  into  its innovations and potential impact.
